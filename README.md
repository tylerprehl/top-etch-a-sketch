# The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch
You can access this webpage by visiting: https://tylerprehl.github.io/top-etch-a-sketch/

The overarching goals of this project are to:
<ul>
<li>"Flex my DOM manipulation skills"</li>
<li>Spend some time doing personal research to use JavaScript and CSS more 
effectively</li>
</ul>
Some more specific cool things I learned along the way:
<ul>
<li>Nothing new yet</li>
</ul>
To do:
<ul>
<li>Only allow coloring while the user is holding the click button</li>
<li>Add rainbow coloring (gradient, not random)</li>
<li>Provide option for black or rainbow coloring</li>
<li>Give it some nice style</li>
</ul>
Update 8/28/2023 - due to a recent lack of motivation, I will be temporarily skipping the rest of my to-do list for this project and moving on to other projects. I'm making this choice mostly because I want to continue learning new content instead of perfecting style design.
